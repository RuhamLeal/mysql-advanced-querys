Create a QUERY that should display four pieces of data:

The first column should have the alias "faturamento_minimo" and display the lowest existing plan value for a person user.

The second column should have the alias "faturamento_maximo" and display the highest plan value that exists for a person.

The third column should have the alias "faturamento_medio" and display the average value of the plans owned by users so far.

Finally, the fourth column should have the alias "faturamento_total" and show the total amount obtained from the plans owned by users.
